        Generally, we do not permit anyone under the age of 18 to use our Sites. However, our Sites
        may be used in school environment, educational institutions may invite and authorise their
        students to use our Sites, and create accounts for them. Where an educational institution
        has contracted with us to collect personal information from students (“
        <strong>Authorised Students</strong>”) for the use and benefit of the educational
        institution, and for no other commercial purpose, Authorised Students who are under the age
        of 18 can use our Sites under the monitoring, supervision and management of their

      <p>
        It is possible that we could receive personal information pertaining to someone under the
        age of 18 who is not Authorised Students by the fraud or deception of a third party or by
        mistake. If you believe that you or someone have accidentally provided us with such personal
        information, please contact your educational institution as soon as possible. If your
        educational institution is unable to rectify the issues and your educational institution
        contacts us for further help, we will verify and investigate such personal information from
        our records upon notification and request. To protect the privacy and security, we may
        require your educational institution and/or you to take certain steps or provide additional
        information for verification before we delete any such information from our records.

        Personal information is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living
        individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the
        identification of a particular person, also constitute personal information. Personal
        information that has been de-identified, encrypted or pseudonymised but can be used to
        re-identify a person remains personal information. Personal information that has been
        rendered anonymous in such a way that the individual is not or no longer identifiable is no
        longer considered personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only collect as much information about the Authorised Students as is reasonably necessary
        for the Authorised Students to participate in an activity, and we do not condition his or

        necessary.

            Our Practices for Notifying and Obtaining Consent Before We Collect Personal information
            from the Authorised Students, including how You May Revoke Consent
          </em>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to comply with laws and regulations (for example, COPPA), we must provide parental
        notification and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information
        from children. Where an educational institution has contracted with us to collect personal
        information from students for the use and benefit of the educational institution, and for no
        other commercial purpose, we are not required to obtain consent directly from parents under
        COPPA, and COPPA allows for such educational institution to act as a parent&apos;s agent and
        to consent under COPPA to the collection of a student&apos;s information on their
        parent&apos;s behalf. It is understood that educational institution&apos;s ability to
        consent is limited to the educational context. We can presume that the educational
        institution&apos;s authorisation for the collection of students&apos; personal information
        is based upon the educational institution having obtained their parents&apos; consent. In
        order for us to rely on consent obtained from the educational institution under COPPA
        instead of the parent, we must provide the educational institution with the same type of
        direct notice regarding our practices as to the collection, use, or disclosure of personal
        information from children as we would otherwise provide to the parent. We also recommend you
        to read our{' '}

        .
      </p>
      <p>
        As we rely on educational institutions to act as agents and provide consent and
        authorisation on parents behalf. The educational institutions must therefore notify the
        Authorised Students&apos; parents and obtain the required verifiable parental consents
        before registering accounts for the Authorised Students and/or inviting Authorised Students
        to use our Sites. The educational institutions can download our{' '}

        . The educational institutions must keep signed verifiable parental consents on file and
        provide them to us upon our request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Educational institutions may revoke consent at any time to refuse our further collection and
        use of the Authorised Students person information by contacting us and providing us
        necessary information for fulfilling the requests. For parents of the Authorised Students,
