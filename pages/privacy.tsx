          <Text className={classes.subTitle}>What data we collect about you</Text>
          <p>
            Personal information is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable
            living individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to
            the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal information.
            Personal information that has been de-identified, encrypted or pseudonymised but can be
            used to re-identify a person remains personal information and falls within the scope of
            the Laws. Personal information that has been rendered anonymous in such a way that the
            individual is not or no longer identifiable is no longer considered personal
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use, store, share and transfer different kinds of your personal information
            depending on the nature of products and/or services we are providing and what we are
            contracted to do for you or the organisation or educational institution on whose behalf
            you are acting. Generally speaking, we process Customer Data and Service Data.
          </p>
          <p>
            “<strong>Customer Data</strong>” is the data that you (including your organisation, your
            educational institutions, a party acting on your behalf and/or your users) provide to us
            through our Sites and the data that you create through the use of our Sites. For
            example, when your organisation or educational institution creates an account for you,
            your organisation or educational institution provides us with certain personal
            information about you that includes the username, email address and password; when you
            use our WhiteBoard, you may choose to save a particular session in the cloud. You
            determine and control what will be included in the Customer Data, and whether or not
            your Customer Data is stored in the cloud provided. We do inspect, approve or monitor
            the data, nor know what kind of data, you choose to store in the cloud provided. Your
            Customer Data is your data and we do not claim ownership over your Customer Data. We
            only process your Customer Data as a data processor in accordance with your
            agreement(s). We will not access, use, disclose or share your Customer Data for any
            purpose without your agreement unless we are required to do so to comply with the law or
            a binding order of a government body. We may use sub-processors, which are our
            affiliates or third parties, to help process Customer Data, fulfill our obligations to
            you, or provide services on our behalf. If your organisation or educational institution
            provides you with user account or access to our Sites, your personal information may
            also be subject to your organisation&apos;s or educational institution&apos;s privacy
            policies and processes, and you should direct privacy inquiries, including any requests
            to exercise your data protection rights, to your organisation or educational
            institution.

          <p>
            “<strong>Service Data</strong>” is the personal information we collect or generate
            during the provision and administration of our Sites and related technical support. For
            example, Service Data includes names, usernames and email. Service Data does not include
            any Customer Data. We are data controller of your Service Data. We have grouped together
            the types of Service Data as follows:

            We may also collect, use, store, share and transfer “<strong>Aggregated Data</strong>”
            such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated Data may be derived
            from your Service Data but is not considered personal information in law as this data
            does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your
            Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific Site feature.
            However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal information so that
            it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal
            information which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.

          <Text className={classes.subTitle}>How long we retain your Service Data</Text>
          <p>
            We will only retain your Service Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we
            collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or
            reporting requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine the appropriate retention period for Service Data, we consider the amount,
            nature, and sensitivity of the Service Data, the potential risk of harm from
            unauthorised use or disclosure of your Service Data, the purposes for which we process
            your Service Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
            applicable legal requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Details of retention periods for different aspects of Service Data are available in our
            retention policy, which is available upon request by contacting us.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see ‘Request erasure’ below
            for further information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, in some circumstances we may anonymise your Service Data (so that it can no
            longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may
            use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
          </p>

          <Text className={classes.subTitle}>How you can exercise your legal rights</Text>

          <p>
            Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to
            your Service Data. You have the right to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Request access </strong>to your Service Data (commonly known as a “data
              subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of your Service Data we
              hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Request correction </strong>of your Service Data that we hold about you. This
              enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected,
              though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. It is
              important that your Service Data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please
              keep us informed if your Service Data changes during your relationship with us.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Request erasure </strong>of your Service Data. This enables you to ask us to
              delete or remove Service Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to
              process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Service Data
              where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below),
              where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to
              erase your Service Data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not
              always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which
              will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Object to processing </strong>of your Service Data where we are relying on a
              legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your
              particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as
              you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may
              demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information
              which override your rights and freedoms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Request restriction of processing </strong>of your Service Data. This enables
              you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Service Data in the following
              scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data&apos;s accuracy; (b) where our use
              of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to
              hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or
              defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to
              verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Request the transfer </strong>of your Service Data to you or to a third party.
              We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Service Data in a
              structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies
              to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where
              we used the information to perform a contract with you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong>where we are relying on consent to
              process your Service Data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any
              processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent,
              we may not be able to provide certain services to you. We will advise you if this is
              the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>No fee usually required</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You will not have to pay a fee to access your Service Data (or to exercise any of the
            other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly
            unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your
            request in these circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What we may need from you</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity
            and ensure your right to access your Service Data (or to exercise any of your other
            rights). This is a security measure to ensure that Service Data is not disclosed to any
            person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
            information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Time limit to respond</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take
            us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number
            of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
